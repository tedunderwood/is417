    "We've been using human-assigned labels to identify clusters of works, and then visualizing them in an abstract space that we inferred algorithmically using PCA.\n",

    "In *theory* we could also use an algorithm to infer discrete clusters of works, instead of relying on human-assigned genre labels.\n",

    "But I have to say, clustering algorithms are more a thing that gets *taught* in data science courses rather than a thing that works well, in practice, on real textual data. If your data is relatively simple and has sharp boundaries between species of iris, or species of penguin, clustering may work on it. Actual cultural data tends to have blurry boundaries and lots of dimensions, and clustering is not especially powerful in that situation.\n",
